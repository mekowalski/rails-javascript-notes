WORKING WITH POST API ENDPOINT
-Once data begins to change on server, requests are made via POST

-POSTING WITH POSTMAN
-Need OAuth token to do this, temporarily display on the page to copy and paste it
eg: searches/search.html.erb
    <%= session[:token] %>
    -Output session[:token], run Rails server and browse /search
    -Should look something like: B2JPA4ZSC5244X1Q1C2OPWYGTZ2LSALF1Z

-Would never output token in real world but just to play around with Postman
