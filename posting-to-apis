WORKING WITH POST API ENDPOINT
-Once data begins to change on server, requests are made via POST

-POSTING WITH POSTMAN
-Need OAuth token to do this, temporarily display on the page to copy and paste it
eg: searches/search.html.erb
    <%= session[:token] %>
    -Output session[:token], run Rails server and browse /search
    -Should look something like: B2JPA4ZSC5244X1Q1C2OPWYGTZ2LSALF1Z

-Would never output token in real world but just to play around with Postman
-Postman will provide list of previous queries under History, grab ID value
eg: post to https://api.foursquare.com/v2/tips/add
    -set params per the docs:
    venueId       YOUR_VENUE_ID
    text          Love this place!
    oauth_token   YOUR_TOKEN
    v             20160201

    -hit Send and should get a response like
    "response": {
      "tip": {
        "id": "56c223e1498e82b67c98f548",
        "createdAt": 1455563745,
        "text": "Love this place!",
        "type": "user",
        "canonicalUrl": "https://foursquare.com/item/56c223e1498e82b67c98f548",
        "likes": {
          "count": 0,
          "groups": []
        },
    // ...
