RUBYGEMS ECOSYSTEM
-Ruby gems are commonly used, frequently: RSpec for testing, frameworks, styling, etc
-Many common issues have already been solved by someone releasing a gem to help, allowing developers to reach
 incredible levels of productivity
-Ruby enables people to freely give back to the community of developers in the form of gems

WHERE TO LOOK

eg: in a non-project directory
    gem search ^twitter$ -d
    =>
