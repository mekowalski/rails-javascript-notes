-With a GET request, params are passed via querystring by putting a ? after the URL and formatting params

-Versioning is important in API usage, this guarantees that anyone using current version can keep using it
 and upgrade to the new version whey they're able to
-Versioning param becomes a form og contract between the API provider and consumer
