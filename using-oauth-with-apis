API USER AUTHENTICATION
-Current level of Authentication to APIs is at the application level with Client Id and Secret
-It is important, allowing API provider to ensure good usage by any client app
-App-level auth gives access to app-level functions but this doesn't require a User
-Not enough for user to be logged into (said API service) and use the App, API service needs to know that the
 app is action on BEHALF of a user that the user is ALLOWED to that action
-Asking a user to login to (said API service) on every request is a horrible experience
-Security issues would arise logistically in 2 places, with (said API service) and your app


ENTER OAUTH
-Provides a way for one application to authenticate to another on behalf of User by means of revokable,
 expirable token
-Also provides a staandard way for app to tell API service 'Hey this user says we can do things for them'
 explicitly authorizing the application

OAuth Authentication Flow
  1. Request access from provider site(often via a direct form)
  2. Redirect back to app site with a code
  3. Request token from provider using code
