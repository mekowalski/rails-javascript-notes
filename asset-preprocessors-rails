PREPROCESSORS
-Because AP parses all asset files, CSS and JS may be written in a language that isn't exactly CSS or JS
-AP recognizes the files aren't normal CSS/JS therefore runs it through a preprocessor which compiles to valid
 CSS/JS
-Development: AP will run preprocessor on any file that needs to be processed every time it's requested(which
 is too slow)
-Running rake asste:precompile  which allows webservers to serve static CSS/JS without ever touching Rails
