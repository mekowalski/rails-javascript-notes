PREPROCESSORS
-Because AP parses all asset files, CSS and JS may be written in a language that isn't exactly CSS or JS
-AP recognizes the files aren't normal CSS/JS therefore runs it through a preprocessor which compiles to valid
 CSS/JS
-Development: AP will run preprocessor on any file that needs to be processed every time it's requested(which
 is too slow)
-Running rake asste:precompile  which allows webservers to serve static CSS/JS without ever touching Rails


COFFEESCRIPT
-Coffeescript simplifies JS by abstraction
-What is left is very Ruby-like syntax
eg:
  launch() if ignition is on

  volume = 10 if band isnt SpinalTap

  letTheWildRumpusBegin() unless answer is no

  if car.speed < limit then accelerate()

  winner = yes if pick in [47, 92, 13]

  print inspect "My name is #{@name}"
