EXTERNAL STYLESHEETS
-Previously loaded CSS from asset directories, which isn't required
-Another way to load CSS is use of standard HTML <style> tags placed in <head> tag of application layout
eg:
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
  </head>


VENDOR ASSETS
-Refer to External-JS-Libraries file, similar but instead of assets/javascripts and vendor/assets/javascripts
 it is assets/stylesheets and vendor/assets/stylesheets


GEMS
-Refer to External-JS-Libraries, all similar but gems installed for CSS/Styling purposes
eg:
  -Add gem 'bootstrap-sass' to Gemfile
  -bundle install
  -Add new gem in css manifest *= require bootstrap
