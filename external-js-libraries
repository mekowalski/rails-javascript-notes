EXTERNAL JAVASCRIPT
-Not all JS files will be loaded from application directories
-Sometimes loading may occur from a CDN that allows saving bandwidth and help with file download speeds
eg:
  <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js" />


VENDOR ASSETS
-With growth of application, build up of JS libraries will be present along the way
-At some point external files will probably be integrated to be internal JS files
-^^With that being said, also don't want to clutter assets/javascripts folder with code written/maintained
 by others
-Rails provides vendor/assets/javascripts to place 3rd party JS libraries and add them to manifest file
-A user may already have that popular library downloaded therefore forcing another downloading
*Vendor assets are to be thought of thoroughly, i've never considered 3rd party JS libraries that i can
 recall*


GEMS
-Many popular JS libraries have gems
-Gems package JS files and when installed, add them to asset path allowing require of JS inside manifest file
eg:
  -Install jQuery gem in Gemfile
  -bundle install and able to add //=require jquery to manifest
  -jQuery will now be loaded by Rails
