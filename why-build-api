Choice of building and providing an API
1. Data is valuable to more than application, or the app has valuable integration points for other
   applications to provide certain services, therefore build External API and open it to 3rd party developers
2. Data is only valuable to company, but accessed in multiple ways(web app, ios app, android app), or
   distribution of service, or just using front-end frameworks, therefore build an Internal API to provide
   common access
