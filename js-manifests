Manifest files have special characteristics that differentiate them from plain old JS files
eg: many manifests files have LOC's that begin with //=
    //= is a directive and tells sprockets that isn't normal JS comment


REQUIRE DIRECTIVES
-require: directive that tells sprockets that the file specified should be loaded
-don't have to put file extension
eg: if file is main.js they type
    //= require main

eg: require_tree tells sprockets to load all files in the given folder
    //= require_tree (will include all JS files in the same folder that application.js is located)
    *this may not be considered due to slow loading of all JS content that doesn't necessarily need to be
     loaded*

-When requiring something in manifest file, provide the asset path
eg: comment.js in the folder /assets/javascripts/blog
    //= require blog/comments
