Need one endpoint to make one request and get back structured data representing site

SERIALIZATION
-Controller renders template containing HTML and data needed
-Data is what's neccessary, NOT the formatting
-Serialization: Process which executable code is represented as a string that can be consumed anywhere
-Serializing an object maintains the state(current object values)
