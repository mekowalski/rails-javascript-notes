SERVICE OBJECTS
-Single Responsibility Principle: purpose of MVC components
-Controller should not be responsible of the API service and the logic of data from API
-Can not move logic out of controller and onto AR Model, no longer working with our own data
-Dealing with another entity's data
-Service Object: an object that can encapsulate the inner workings of business or domain logic that isn't
 strictly the responsibility of a single AR Model
