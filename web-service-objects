SERVICE OBJECTS
-Single Responsibility Principle: purpose of MVC components
-Controller should not be responsible of the API service and the logic of data from API
-Can not move logic out of controller and onto AR Model, no longer working with our own data
-Dealing with another entity's data
-Service Object: an object that can encapsulate the inner workings of business or domain logic that isn't
 strictly the responsibility of a single AR Model


REFACTORING AUTHENTICATION
Extracting A Service Object
  1. Create app/services folder and create api_service.rb file within
  2. Define APIService class
  eg: app/services/api_service.rb
      class APIService
      end

  3. Move API interaction from SessionCon into APIService
    -Define method #authenticate!
    eg:
      def authenticate!(client_id, client_secret, code)
        resp = Faraday.get('https://foursquare.com/oauth2/access_token') do |req|
          req.params['client_id'] = client_id
          req.params['client_secret'] = client_secret
          req.params['grant_type'] = 'authorization_code'
          req.params['redirect_uri'] = 'http://localhost:3000/auth'
          req.params['code'] = code
        end
        body = JSON.parse(resp.body)
        body['access_token']
      end

*Familiar, moving code from controller to service object, passing in params from controller*


BACK TO CONTROLLER
-Instantiate new APIService object in SessionsCon and call #authenticate! method
eg: sessions_controller.rb
    def create
      foursquare = APIService.new
      session[:token] = foursquare.authenticate!(ENV['FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['FOURSQUARE_SECRET'], params[:code])
      redirect_to root_path
    end

*Controller is much cleaner and it only has to know that APIService can provide OAuth Token*


REFACTORING FRIENDS
-Need to also clean up #friends action , extracting API call from #friends action to the service object
eg: service/api_service.rb
    def friends(token)
      resp = Faraday.get('https://api/foursquare.com/v2/users/self/friends') do |req|
        req.params['oauth_token'] = token
        req.params['v'] = '20160201'
      end
      JSON.parse(resp.body)['response']['friends']['items']
    end

*Go as far as just to return the part of JSON response needed to build friends list*

-Update #friends to use service object
eg: searches_controller.rb
    def friends
      foursquare = APIService.new
      @friends = foursquare.friends(session[:token])
    end
