Asset pipeline is Rails answer to managing stylesheets, JS and images

ASSET PATHS
-Asset pipeline provides answers to problems or creating, organizing and location of files
-Two problems arise with separate folders and files
  1. How does Rails know where things are
  2. Serving each file separately loads a page slowly and adding files together to load 1 JS and 1 CSS file
     (concatenation), isn't ideal

ONE: Asset Pipeline has concept called Asset Paths for handling where to look
  -Combination of folder paths for Rails to look for assets in
  -Can access and asset vial URL with '/assets' in application
  -Additional folders to search can be added to the Asset Path in the config/initializers/assets.rb file
  eg: Rails.application.config.assets.paths << 'New Path'

TWO: Manifests and Concatenation
-As files can be put anywhere, Asset Pipeline uses a manifest file to tell Rails what to load
-Central file where CSS and JS files can be listed for application needs
eg: app/assets/javascripts/application.js
    //= require jquery
    //= require calendar(if that's your app)
    *Asset Pipeline will search all configured paths for a file with the name provided L21*

-Manifest files configured in Rails will automatically concatenate the files listed into one file
-Rails will actually serve each file separately when running in development mode
