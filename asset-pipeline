Asset pipeline is Rails answer to managing stylesheets, JS and images

ASSET PATHS
-Asset pipeline provides answers to problems or creating, organizing and location of files
-Two problems arise with separate folders and files
  1. How does Rails know where things are
  2. Serving each file separately loads a page slowly and adding files together to load 1 JS and 1 CSS file
     (concatenation), isn't ideal
