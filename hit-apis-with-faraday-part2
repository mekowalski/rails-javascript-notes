HANDLING ERRORS
-Can't necessarily prevent every possible error because we aren't in control of the API
-Need to understand how to report API errors and handle them
-Response holds the Body where all the data is and the Status, the Status contains the HTTP code
-The Status is the equivalent to the HTTP code of good or bad
eg: 200: OK, 400: ERROR
