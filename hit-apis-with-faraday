FARADAY
-HTTP client library that abstracts and standardizes dome lower-level HTTP functions, aiding in building
 requests and getting responses from API
-Allows maintainence of the same client code even if changed in underlying library later
eg: Faraday Gem
    add to Gemfile and run 'bundle install'

    //searches_controller.rb
    def foursquare
      Faraday.get'https://api.foursqaure.com/v2/venues/search' do |req|
        req.params['client_id'] = client_id
        req.params['client_secret'] = client_secret
        req.params['v'] = '20160201'
        req.params['near'] = params[:zipcode]
        req.params['query'] = 'coffee shop'
      end
      render 'search'
    end
