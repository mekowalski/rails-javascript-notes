CREATING AN OBJECT WITH AJAX POST
-With a form already built, the form will be used BUT alongside jQuery and AJAX to submit the form
-This will handle a JSON response and display the newly created object without redirecting the show page
1. Prevent default form submit action and customize the action with and event handler
   eg: objects/new.html.erb
   <%= for_for(@object) do |f| %>
     //code for :title
     //code for :description
     <div class='actions'>
      <%= f.submit %>
     </div>
   <% end %>

   <script type='text/javascript' charset='utf-8'>
     $(function() {
       $('form').submit(function(e) {
         e.preventDefault() //prevent form from submitting the default way and sends alert instead
         alert('we r hack3rz')
       })
     })
   </script>

2. Retrieve the form values and POST them to /objects, which is the route for creating a new Object
   eg: objects/new.html.erb
   <script type='text/javascript' charset='utf-8'>
     $(function() {
       $('form').submit(function(e) {
         e.preventDefault() //prevent form from submitting the default way and sends alert instead
         var values = $(this).serialize() //talkes form data and serializes
         var objecting = $.post('/objects', values) //jQuery post() to pass in URL and values
         posting.done(function(data) { //specifiy what should happen when AJAX request is done
           //TODO: Handle response
         })
       })
     })
   </script>


GETTING RESPONSE FROM AJAX POST
-With AJAX request, Data is expected to be returned to deal with on the client side
-When controller redirected and rendered show page, it actually sent Data to .done() method
eg: console.log(data) => returns hfull HTML of show page for new object

Side-note About HTTP Codes
-HTTP status codes exist to let client know response received and what to do about it
-redirect_to status code: 302, knows it needs to follow the 'redirect' to given link and load that link next
-302 considered temporary or found
-AJAX requests don't follow redirects because they CANNOT
-AJAX chooses NOT to follow link and instead takes whatever rendered DATA is
