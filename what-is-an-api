SCREEN SCRAPING
-A technique where a URL is requested in the same way a browser would, but done in code instead of seeing
 rendered HTML
-Having to parse HTML to see what's needed
eg: Foursquare: coffee shops in NY
    https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=New%20York&q=coffee%20shops
    -Could use Nokogiri and Ruby to request page to parse data
    //IRB
    doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open('https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=New%20York&q=coffee%20shops'))

    -Gives a full search results page from Foursquare and can inspect source, figuring out the results in a
     specific tag are(<li>)
    //IRB
    doc.css('li.singleRecommendation').each do |rec|
      #code in  here
    end

-What happens when minor CSS tweak occurs and .singleRecommentdation changes to .recommendationCard
-The whole app would break and wouldn't be known until a user gets an error


API(APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE)
-Way for system to interact with another via well-defined interface
-Interface: any endpoint used to take actions and consume data on given applicaiton
-Data: dynamic values like: names, addresses, checkins
