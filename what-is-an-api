SCREEN SCRAPING
-A technique where a URL is requested in the same way a browser would, but done in code instead of seeing
 rendered HTML
-Having to parse HTML to see what's needed
eg: Foursquare: coffee shops in NY
    https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=New%20York&q=coffee%20shops
    -Could use Nokogiri and Ruby to request page to parse data
    //IRB
    doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open('https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=New%20York&q=coffee%20shops'))

    -Gives a full search results page from Foursquare and can inspect source, figuring out the results in a
     specific tag are(<li>)
    //IRB
    doc.css('li.singleRecommendation').each do |rec|
      #code in  here
    end
