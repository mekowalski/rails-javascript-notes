Page-specific JS files help organize JS into different files based on functionality
(ALWAYS SEPARATION OF CONCERNS)

PAGE SPECIFIC JS IN MANIFEST
-Rails Generators creates a new resource and page-specific JS and CSS files
-This is where any JS should be put to the pages associated with the resource
eg: Beer resource
    app/assets/javascripts/application.js
    //= require beers (although mine has require_tree for all the resources of the app)


CONTROLLER SPECIFIC JS
-To prevent massive amounts of files to run in a large application, allow for pages to load only when in use
 of the name of the controller
eg:
  <%= javascript_include_tag params[:controller] %>

-Instead load file based of the controller's name
-But no longer getting benefits of asset concatenation or caching
