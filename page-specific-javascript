Page-specific JS files help organize JS into different files based on functionality
(ALWAYS SEPARATION OF CONCERNS)

PAGE SPECIFIC JS IN MANIFEST
-Rails Generators creates a new resource and page-specific JS and CSS files
-This is where any JS should be put to the pages associated with the resource
eg: Beer resource
    app/assets/javascripts/application.js
    //= require beers (although mine has require_tree for all the resources of the app)
