-to_json output may return deeply nested data
-Keeping track of nested data in a to_json call may be frustrating and near impossible to maintain


ACTIVEMODEL::SERIALIZER
-ActiveModel::Serializer(AMS): provdes convention-based approach to serializing resources in a Rails way
-By default Rails will use serializer if simply calling 'render json: @object' in controller
-In previous serializer written by hand, explicitly tell Rails what data to return
-AMS will take care of this ^^^ for us
-More importantly, AMS doesn't require building out JSON strings

-RAILS 5 goal is to allow creation of lean, efficient API-only Rails apps.
  -M and C without V
  -Popularity with robust front-end frameworks(React and Angular) Rails needed a strip down to serve as an
   API and AMS
  -Rails moves forward by NOT being tied to View layer
