-In previous lesson, Serializer worked will BUT with String concatenation and keeping track of all the single
 and double quotes is a nightmare
-Imagine writing more serializers for more than 4 fields


TO_JSON
-Rails provides to_json method taking, object and converting it TO_JSON!!!
eg: posts_controller.rb
    def post_data
      post = Post.find(params[:id])
      render json: post.to_json
    end

-Updates post body without changing a thing


INCLUDING ASSOCIATIONS
-to_json only updates the main object NOT any associations
-To change this, tell to_json to 'include' associated objects
eg: posts_controller.rb
    def post_data
      post = Post.find(params[:id])
      render json: post.to_json(include: :author)
    end
