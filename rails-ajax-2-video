Submit Form via Client Side Model
-Add new Beer and add that on the DOM
-New form and add that(append) under the current index of beers

-Need to somehow use the form when creating a new Beer and append that to the list of current beers
[]First hijack the New Beer submit on form
eg: companies.js file
    $(function() {
      $('a.companies-new-beer').on('click', function(e) {
        e.preventDefault()
        alert('this worked!')
      })
    })

    -Need URL to submit POST request to
    -Need the form data

[]Then take form data and send it to server as AJAX Post request
  -Have the form to fill out information
  -How to know the URL of the POST request
[]Take data from AJAX POST request and create corresponding instance
  -Then append that new Beer to the list of current beers(with a link as the others have)
[]Send back HTML/JSON of new Beer added and append  to DOM
