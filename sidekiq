WORKERS
-Rails Workers: processes that will allow execution tasks outside the main web app thread
-Processing file takes the same thread at the request/response therefore making it time consuming
-File processing becomes a blocking action on thread
-Rails provides many tools to move blocking tasks to a background worker allowing faster response


SIDEKIQ
-Sidekiq: moves lead processing to a background thread, most popular background worker
eg: Add in Gemfile
    gem 'sidekiq'
    bundle install

-Sidekiq relies on a Worker to define and process a job
eg: app/workers/lead_workers.rb *although i don't workers in many of my projects*
    class LeadsWorker
      include SideKiq::Worker

      def perform(leads_file)
      end
    end

-Basic shape of any worker
  -include Sidekiq::Worker
  -define perform
