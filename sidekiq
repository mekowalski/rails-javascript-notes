WORKERS
-Rails Workers: processes that will allow execution tasks outside the main web app thread
-Processing file takes the same thread at the request/response therefore making it time consuming
-File processing becomes a blocking action on thread
-Rails provides many tools to move blocking tasks to a background worker allowing faster response
