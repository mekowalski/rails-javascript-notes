AP helps deal with images easier, build paths and deal with caching problems

WHERE DO IMAGES GO
-Images can be kept in app/assets/images which is already included in the asset paths by default
-Possible to add more images by adding Rails.application.assets.paths
-May access images with standard /assets URL, with a consistent URL looking everywhere for the image
eg: "assets/image.png"

-Because it's an array you can easily shovel in more directories in images are not on the list
eg: config/application.rb
    config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('lib', 'randomeimagefolder')
