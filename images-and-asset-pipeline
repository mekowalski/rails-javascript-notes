AP helps deal with images easier, build paths and deal with caching problems

WHERE DO IMAGES GO
-Images can be kept in app/assets/images which is already included in the asset paths by default
-Possible to add more images by adding Rails.application.assets.paths
-May access images with standard /assets URL, with a consistent URL looking everywhere for the image
eg: "assets/mountains.png"

-Because it's an array you can easily shovel in more directories in images are not on the list
eg: config/application.rb
    config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('lib', 'randomeimagefolder')


ASSET_PATH HELPER
-asset_path: provides a way to retrieve relative path to an image file in AP
eg:
  asset_path('mountains.png')

-If AP finds file, it returns path to image
eg:
  /assets/mountains.png

-If file is in sub-folder in image DIR, that will need to be included
eg:
  asset_path('banner/mountains.png')
  => /assets/banner/mountains.png

-If asset_path cannot find file, path returned will prepend filename with /
eg:
  /mountains.png

-asset_path is helpful got image paths located in CSS files
eg:
  .logo {
    background-image: url(<%= asset_path('mountains') %>)
  }
